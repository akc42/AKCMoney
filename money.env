# The environment variables below are added to the process.env object in the server application just after startup
# The DO NOT replace any variables already defined in the run time environment.  So if you which to place your database (for instance) elsewhere
# just ensure your environment already contains DATABASE_DB_DIR.  Similarly of you want to change the database initialisation file in order
# to have the settings table have YOUR values in - then also define DATABASE_INIT_FILE.  HOWEVER BEWARE.  If you have MULTIPLE applications using
# the same database utilities - setting your environment on logon could reset all applications.  A better approach is to set the environment in something like PM2,
# so it is only set for this application. 

DATABASE_DB=money.db
#Update version is db schema changes, be sure to provide update_"oldVersion".sql (old version is version changing from) 
# and possibly pre-upgrade_"oldVersion".sql and post-upgrade_"oldVersion".sql files.  Next server startup will use these to upgrade db in place.
DATABASE_DB_VERSION=1
# It should be the relative to server (including ../xxx if needed) or absolute path to the database file
DATABASE_DB_DIR=db
DATABASE_DB_BUSY=5000
DATABASE_INIT_FILE=server/db-init/database.sql

# NOTE All remaining settings other than the "DEBUG" environment variable for server side debug statements are in database (settings table).
# client side setttings are read from the database on every client startup, server side, when the server first starts.  
# So restart server if you change server side veriables, not necessary if you change settings that are only client side.
