AKCMoney is an application to Manage Money, either for a private
individual or a small business, or in the later releases both.  

It consist of three main concepts:-

Domains - which hold accounts, and for which we want to account

Accounts - which hold money (in a currency)

Transactions - which transfer money from one account to another (or 
just to or from a single account if the transaction is with the 
outside world).  

Multiple currencies are supported, and can use exchange rates which are 
initially estimated, but are then corrected when the actual value used 
in a transaction is known.  

Each side of the transaction can optionally be assigned an "Accounting Code"
which belongs to one of "Costs","Revenue","Assets" (Depreciated over 3 years),
"Balance" (items such as expensed and their re-embersment, which are therefore
expected to round out to zero) and "Offsheet" (Off balance sheet amounts, such
as profits declared and dividents paid which are separately accounted for
cumulatively over time to ensure that only the profits actually achieved are
paid out in dividends) 

I have been using v3 of this application for the past 6 years and although it does 
everything that I want, there are little issues which detract.  For instance scolling
down a long list of transactions looses the menu and action buttons from the top, or
trying to clear lots of transactions because the whole account has been reconcilled has to be
done one transaction at a time, or manually calculating a new figure to make the end balance
of an account zero could be automated (used when I need to calculate monthly repayments when I
have borrowed from elsewhere).

So I am working towards the 4th release of this software.  Moving on from php into a 
nodejs based server application with a custom elements (using lit-element) front end.

This will allow me to address those small niggles, but at the same time make the application
more mobile friendly so that I can also do work on my mobile phone.

So right now the master branch does not have working code.  The original php code has been
moved to the supporting/old_app directory so its available for reference, but I do not have
a development environment capable of supporting it.

One final point to make - I want to explore using jest and playwright for both server and client
testing.  It may not work out, but I need to find out if I can make it work for another of my projects.
