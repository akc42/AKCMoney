AKCMoney is an application to Manage Money, either for a private
individual or a small business, or in the later releases both.  

It consist of three main concepts:-

Domains - which hold accounts, and for which we want to account

Accounts - which hold money (in a currency)

Transactions - which transfer money from one account to another (or 
just to or from a single account if the transaction is with the 
outside world).  

Multiple currencies are supported, and can use exchange rates which are 
initially estimated, but are then corrected when the actual value used 
in a transaction is known.  

Each side of the transaction can optionally be assigned an "Accounting Code"
which belongs to one of "Costs","Revenue","Assets" (Depreciated over 3 years),
"Balance" (items such as expenses and their re-embersment, which are therefore
expected to round out to zero) and "Offsheet" (Off balance sheet amounts, such
as profits declared and dividents paid which are separately accounted for
cumulatively over time to ensure that only the profits actually achieved are
paid out in dividends) 

I have been using versions of this application for the past 16 years to manage my own money and that of my business (in
separate Domains). I've been able to slowly add features I've needed

The transistion to javascript (v4) and custom elements has been completed somewhile ago. Also the application has been
through a couple of iterations using docker containers for the client and server parts of the application.  Release
4.3.0 saw the restructuring of that approach so that the containers only had the frameworks for the application built
into them and the rest (client and server code) was mapped to using the docker volume facilities to code directories on
the appropriate server. For development that is my local development machine, for production it is a synology NAS.  




One final point to make - I want to explore using jest and playwright for both server and client testing.  It may not
work out, but I need to find out if I can make it work for another of my projects. Any code in the test directory is (at
the moment) unlikely to work.
